🧠 BitBridge Auth — login system made by a sleep-deprived dev tryna vibe
So like... this was supposed to be a chill auth microservice 😎
Now it’s a whole OAuth2 / Keycloak dungeon run and I forgot to bring a healer 💀

🔐 What it do tho?
Handles loginz, sends tokenz, vibes with Keycloak like they BFFs 🤝
Probably secure... maybe... idk I just copy-pasted half the config from StackOverflow 😅
It works — as long as you don’t look too close 👀

👨‍💻 The code?
Yes. It exists. It runs. It cries at night.
First date with Spring Security so don’t judge the spaghetti yet 🍝
I’m still figuring out wtf is going on with half of these filters 😭

🚧 What’s next?
Frontend coming sooooon™ 💻💅 (React + chaos)
More features? More refactors? More caffeine-fueled breakdowns?
Hell yeah. Stay tuned. 🔥🔥🔥

🧪 Learning project but also my emotional support app rn. Be kind. 💕
🚀 Updates dropping soon — probably with bugs but also with love 💌
