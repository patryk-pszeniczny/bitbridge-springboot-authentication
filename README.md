🧠 BitBridge Auth — login system by a dev running on caffeine & vibes

So this started as a “quick” auth microservice...  
Now it’s a whole-ass OAuth2 dungeon crawler and I forgot to spec a healer 💀  
Built with Spring Security, confusion, and questionable life choices.

🔐 What it do?
- Handles logins like a boss  
- Tosses JWTs like candy 🍬  
- Lowkey besties with Keycloak 🤝  
- Might be secure... might be held together with duct tape and StackOverflow threads 😅

👨‍💻 The code?
Yeah it runs. Yeah it cries at night.  
My first date with Spring Security — and it’s already complicated af 🍝  
Filters? Providers? Token converters?? bro idk I’m just trying my best 😭

🚧 What’s next?
- Frontend comin’ soon™ (React + vibes + chaos)  
- More features? Probably.  
- More refactors? Hopefully.  
- More sleepless nights and inner screaming? Absolutely 🔥

🧪 It’s a learning project, but also my therapy session in code form.  
💌 Expect bugs. Expect love. Updates dropping whenever I get my life together.
